New Notes

should include amount of scrolling in fitness ? (jquery plugins etc)

add gene (long stretch of 111111's maybe) for color or monochrome

feasibility test after crossover (also point-to-point crossover)

LOL borders?

most important things are fitness funtion and coding

issues with fitness function: how to account for different users' timing (some fast, some slow)

is time the best metric? is scrolling better? -> scrolling should use percentage of total since bigger fonts -> more scrolling

===

Admin console

HTTP digest authentication (npm passport.js)

text area for fitness function (?? syntax highlighting)
need scrolling data

Graph of average fitness per generation (d3.js)
currently connected users

calculation of "average" chromosome per generation (and real time)
BigInt or BigNum (openssl) libraries for integer math (both support hex ints)
probably best to keep the working average just in memory, and push to DB after each
generation has "died"

should average be recomputed with every new push? or after a specific number of milliseconds?
how can jquery be used to animate the changes in parameters (if at all -> yes http://jqueryui.com/switchClass/)?

genealogy pages > best way to visually trace parents
	show chromosome map
	and maybe a thumbnail > how to generate thumbnails. is there a webkit plugin?
	compare two windows? side by side
	how to load chromosomes? GET request on a form (_id)
	need some way of viewing phenotype

===

Use views, for each module in /docs/ folder
markup documents with jade templates
separate out headers and scripts into seperate assets to be served from /lib/ static directory
use routes?? so get('/v/:articleId' render ... etc

===

NEED to make/develop persistance -> also, delete all documents vs dropping the database on initialize to make
compatible with Nodjitsu's setup
